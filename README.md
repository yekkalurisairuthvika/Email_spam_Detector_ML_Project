#Email or SMS Spam Detection Using MachineLearning


#INTRODUCTION


Email spam has become a significant problem in today's digital age, posing challenges for individuals, businesses, and organizations alike. Spam emails are unsolicited messages that flood inboxes, wasting valuable time and resources while potentially exposing users tomalicious content or scams. To combat this issue, machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for email spam detection.

The objective of email spam detection is to accurately classify incoming emails as either legitimate (ham) or spam. Traditional rule-based approaches have limited effectiveness due to the constantly evolving nature of spam. Machine learning offers a more dynamic and adaptableapproach by leveraging patterns and features extracted from large email datasets.

Machine learning algorithms can learn from labeled email datasets to build models capable of recognizing patterns indicative of spam. These models can then be used to automatically classify new, unseen emails. By analyzing variousemail attributes such as sender information,subject line, content, machine learning algorithms can identify spam characteristics and make accurate predictions.


The project involves building a model to analyze the text of emails anddetermine whether they are spam or legitimate. This study has the potential to provide a valuable solution to the problem of email spam and help users to manage their emailsmore effectively.
